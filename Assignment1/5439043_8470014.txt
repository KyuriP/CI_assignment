## Description
Loading "5439043_8470014.RData" will restore the "OCDDEP" data set.
OCDDEP is a hypothetical dataset that contains scores on 
OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and depression symptoms for 500 people. 
Given the high comorbidity between OCD and depression, this data set is created in order 
to investigate the potential (causal) links between each of the symptom variables.  

## Format
OCDDEP is a data frame with 500 cases (rows) and 8 variables (columns), 
where each of the variables are either OCD or depression symptoms. 
Each symptom is considered as a continuous variable (i.e., measured on continuous scale)
except for "dicho_ocdis"(dichotomized version of "ocdis") which is a categorical variable. 
OCD symptoms are named "ocint", "ocdis", "occon", and "dicho_ocdis"(dichotomized version of "ocdis"). 
Depression symptoms are named "sad", "insom", "concen", and "guilt".

## Overview of variables
ocint - interference due to obsessions/compulsions 
ocdis - distress caused by obsessions/compulsions (MAIN CAUSE OF INTEREST)
dicho_ocdis - dichotomized version of ocdis (MAIN CAUSE OF INTEREST - dichotomized)
occon - difficulty controlling obsessions/compulsions 
sad - sadness 
insom - insomnia/sleeping problems
concen - concentration/decision-making impairment 
guilt - guilt and self-blame (MAIN OUTCOME OF INTEREST)
